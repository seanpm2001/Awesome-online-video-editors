# Comparing online video editors

On 2022, August 4th, I spent over 2 hours trying to edit a clip down from 1 minute 44 seconds to 4 seconds. I was very persistent, and eventually met my goal. I originally tried KDenlive, but it was too complicated for the time, and I went to use online video editing for the first time. There were lots of poor services, I tried out several, and only found 1 good service.

The next day, I compiled this list to demonstrate the pros and cons of the current top 11 online video editors.

**Personal opinion:** [Online-video-trimmer](https://online-video-cutter.com/) and any other site that does exactly what it does should be all there is on the front page of results, and not be on page 2. I feel that entries ranked 2-11 should be on page 2 or 3, or even further down.
