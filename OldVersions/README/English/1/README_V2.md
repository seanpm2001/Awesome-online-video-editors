# Comparing online video editors

On 2022, August 4th, I spent over 2 hours trying to edit a clip down from 1 minute 44 seconds to 4 seconds. I was very persistent, and eventually met my goal. I originally tried KDenlive, but it was too complicated for the time, and I went to use online video editing for the first time. There were lots of poor services, I tried out several, and only found 1 good service.

The next day, I compiled this list to demonstrate the pros and cons of the current top 11 online video editors.

| Rank | Service name | Contains watermarks | Supports Firefox | Does not support Firefox | Supports MKV | Requires an online account | Requires a subscription | GIF export | Violates WebCompat | Exports in MP4 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Online-video-trimmer](https://online-video-cutter.com/) | False | True | False | True | False | False | False | False | True |
| 02 | [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/) | Yes ($1.00 to remove) | True | False | Unknown | True | For 720p and higher | True | False | True |
| 03 | [Clideo](https://clideo.com/video-editor/) | True | True | False | True | False | For original quality video, 720p or higher | False | False | True |
| 04 | [FastReel](https://www.fastreel.com/) | Yes ($1.00 to remove) | True | False | Unknown | Yes (to export) | Subscription required for 720p and higher| False| False | False | True | 
| 05 | [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/video-editor/) | True | True | False | True | False | To export in 1080p and to remove watermarks | False | False | True | True | False | False |
| 06 | [MovAVI](https://www.movavi.com/videoeditor/) | True | True | False | False | False | True | False | False | True |
| 07 | [Frixier](https://editor.flixier.com/home/) | True ($8.00/yearly or $14.00/monthly to remove | Partially | Encourages Chrome | True | False | True (for watermark removal) | False | Yes | True |
| 08 | [Biteable](https://biteable.com/) | False | True | True | True | Yes | To export video, a subscription is required | False | False | True |
| 09 | [Pixiko](https://pixiko.com/) | False | True | True | Yes | An online account is required | A subscription is required to export video | False | False | True |
| 10 | [Kizoa](https://kizoa.com/) | Yes | Partially | False | Unknown | True | For 1080p and higher | False | True | True |
| 11 | [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/unsupported-browser/) | Unknown | False | True | Unknown | Yes | Unknown | False | True | True |

**Personal opinion:** [Online-video-trimmer](https://online-video-cutter.com/) and any other site that does exactly what it does should be all there is on the front page of results, and not be on page 2. I feel that entries ranked 2-11 should be on page 2 or 3, or even further down.
